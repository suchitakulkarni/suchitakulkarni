# Hi, I’m Suchita Kulkarni

I am a machine learning engineer with a background in theoretical physics, focused on models that integrate structure, constraints, and domain knowledge into learning systems.

My work sits at the intersection of machine learning, dynamical systems, and scientific modeling, with an emphasis on robustness, interpretability, and generalisation.
