# Hi, I’m Suchita Kulkarni

I am a machine learning engineer with a background in theoretical physics, focused on models that integrate structure, constraints, and domain knowledge into learning systems.

My work sits at the intersection of machine learning, dynamical systems, and scientific modeling, with an emphasis on robustness, interpretability, and generalisation.

## Selected projects

### 🔹  Physics-Informed Latency Prediction and Anomaly Detection

- Physics-aware anomaly detection for networked systems, where available data is sparse and reliable extrapolation is required.

- The model prioritises physically meaningful anomalies over purely data-driven sensitivity, favouring stability and interpretability under limited observability.

- Focus: interpretable modeling, robustness, uncertainty estimation
  
- Implementation: linear regression, probabilistic anomaly detection

  * [Streamlit interface](https://physics-informed-latency-pred.streamlit.app/)

### 🔹 Physics-Informed Time-Series Modeling and Anomaly Detection

- Comparative study of physics-informed LSTM and purely data-driven LSTM models for oscillatory time-series analysis and anomaly detection.

- The work favours physics-informed constraints to stabilise detection performance under stricter decision thresholds, trading raw flexibility for more consistent behaviour.

- Focus: modeling assumptions, robustness, diagnostics
  
- Implementation: LSTM architectures, physics-informed loss terms, threshold-based evaluation
  * [Code](https://github.com/suchitakulkarni/PI-LSTM)
  * [Stremlit interface exploring hyperparameter importance](https://pinnlearning.streamlit.app/)

### 🔹 Structure-Aware Generative Models

- Exploration of VAE-based generative models in settings where unconstrained samples violate known physical structure.

- The approach constrains generation to preserve physical validity, accepting reduced diversity in exchange for consistency and downstream usability.

- Focus: representation learning, constraints, generalisation
  
- Implementation: variational autoencoders, structured latent spaces, constraint-based regularisation
  * Repository: (In progress)

### 🔹 Remaining Unit Life predictions on NASA turbofan dataset

- Remaining useful life estimation on the NASA turbofan dataset under heterogeneous operating conditions, with explicit uncertainty quantification.

- The model emphasises calibrated uncertainty over sharp point estimates, accepting wider intervals to reduce overconfident end-of-life failures.

- Focus: uncertainty quantification, robustness, representation learning
  
- Implementation: random forests, uncertainty calibration, hyperparameter optimisation
